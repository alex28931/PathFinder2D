# 🧭 Top-Down Game (C#)

A 2D top-down game developed in C#, focused on intelligent character navigation, interactive scenes.

## 🎮 Key Features

- **Character Movement Using A-star Algorithm**  
  The player moves through the game world using a custom A* pathfinding system, enabling smart and obstacle-aware navigation.

- **Tilemap-Based World Design with Tiled**  
  The game world is built using [Tiled](https://www.mapeditor.org/), a flexible tilemap editor. TMX maps are parsed and rendered in-game to create modular and efficient level layouts.

- **Multi-Scene Environment**  
  The game is composed of several scenes, each with interactive elements and collectible objects.

- **Dynamic Visibility System**  
  A cave area is initially obscured by a post-processing effect to simulate darkness. When the player collects a torch, the effect is removed and visibility is restored.

## 🧱 Technologies & Systems

- **C#**
- **A-star Pathfinding Algorithm**
- **Tiled Map Editor (.tmx integration)**
